#Peace Corps Hub

###Background

Systers has partnered with Peace Corps to develop several web and mobile applications. All of the applications have separate repos on our GitHub page, but we don't have a central HUB for Peace Corps staff and volunteers to access all of the applications.


###Goal of the Hack

The goal of the hackathon is to create a web application that will be the Peace Corps App HUB. The hub should have login access, but also include access to all of our Peace Corps products. The language you choose must be open source as to keep to the initiative of open government initiative of the Peace Corps.

Note: We do have mobile products. How would users view/access mobile products?

List of all of Systers Peace Corps projects can be found here >> [Systers GitHub page](http://systers.github.io/)

The Peace Corps Hub should include at the highest level access to the following.
1. Mobile App Control Center
2. Ushahidi Crowdmap (this contains only one Ushahidi application.
3. Photo Language Translation

The Mobile App Control Center should access the following Peace Corps mobile applications.
1. PeaceTrack
2. Malaria
3. PCSA

All this work was performed during Systers Google Summer of Code 2014 and 2015. Please see the GSoC assignments so for each year so that you can see what the students have worked on for each of the project. This is not a requirement, but you may want to read background on the projects.

####After The Hack

#### Project Description:
We've built several web and mobile applications for Peace Corps. We've also created a Mobile App Control Center (MACC) to push notifications and updates from web application to mobile app. However, the next phase in bringing all of the applications together is a Peace Corps Hub. 

We have initial design of the web application from Qualcomm EmpowHerment Hackathon. Please visit the [winners' page](http://devpost.com/software/pchub) for initial design.
